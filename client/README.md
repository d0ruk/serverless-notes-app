The UI is a React/Redux/Router app that uses components from the antd lib. Manages AWS interactions via the aws-amplify lib.

* App detects the auth status through an ```auth.cognitoUser``` key in the redux state. This is passed down to child component's via ```<App />```'s context. Routes only check for the existence of this key. It should only be set to a truthy value when the app has a *valid* user in state.
